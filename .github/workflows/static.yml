Sir, I've reviewed your GitHub Actions workflow for deploying a React app to GitHub Pages.

The structure is mostly solid — good use of the official Pages deployment actions, auto-detection of build vs dist, linting, tests — but there are a few issues that are very likely causing it to fail in early 2026:

    Deprecated artifact action
    You're using actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3, but GitHub has enforced deprecation rules around late 2024 / early 2025.
    Many workflows started failing automatically because they (directly or indirectly) relied on the old v3 artifact backend.
    The correct versions in 2026 are usually upload-pages-artifact@v3 paired with deploy-pages@v4 — wait, yours already has @v4 for deploy… but the combination may still be tripping over the artifact backend change.

    Most up-to-date examples pin actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3 explicitly and it continues to work with deploy-pages@v4.

    Missing actions/configure-pages
    Official GitHub Pages deployment workflows almost always include actions/configure-pages before uploading the artifact.
    Without it, some environments (especially after 2025 changes) can behave unpredictably or fail silently.

    React single-page app routing will almost certainly 404 on refresh
    Your current workflow deploys correctly, but because GitHub Pages is a static host, client-side routes (React Router, etc.) will return 404 when refreshed or directly accessed unless you use one of the standard workarounds (copy index.html → 404.html, or use HashRouter).

Here’s the cleaned-up, modernised version that should work reliably in February 2026:

            echo "::error::Build output directory not found (expected ./dist or ./build)"
            exit 1
          fi
